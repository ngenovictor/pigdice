### 1. Game Workflow
> * 2 users competing against each other load up the home page
> * Each player gets a turn to roll the dice
> * Each turn, a player repeatedly rolls a die until either a 1 is rolled or the player decides to "hold"
> * If the player rolls a 1, they score nothing and it becomes the next player's turn.
> * If the player rolls any other number, it is added to their turn total and the player's turn continues.
> * If a player chooses to "hold", their turn total is added to their score, and it becomes the next player's turn.
> * The first player to score 100 or more points wins
